# Wine Quality Data Analysis

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  The goal is to understand the characteristics of the dataset, identify potential relationships between variables, and prepare the data for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Project Structure

* `import.py`: Script to fetch and display basic information about the dataset (metadata and variables).
* `init_analsys.py`: Script to perform the core EDA, including summary statistics, missing value checks, correlation analysis, and visualizations.
* `data-info.md`:  A detailed report generated by the `init_analsys.py` script, summarizing the findings of the EDA.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages for this project.
* `install_dependencies.py`:  Automates the creation of a virtual environment and installation of project dependencies.


## Dataset

The Wine Quality Dataset contains physicochemical and sensory data for red and white Vinho Verde wines from northern Portugal. The goal is to model wine quality based on these features.  The dataset can be accessed through the UCI Machine Learning Repository ([https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git  (Replace with your actual repository URL)
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  (.venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the import script:**
   ```bash
   python import.py
   ```

5. **Run the analysis script:**
   ```bash
   python init_analsys.py
   ```

The analysis results will be printed to the console and also saved in the `data-info.md` file.


## Analysis Summary

The `init_analsys.py` script provides a comprehensive summary of the dataset, including:

* Number of rows and columns
* Data types of each column
* Missing value check
* Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, percentiles)
* Unique value counts for each column
* Frequency distribution of values
* Correlation matrix
* Histograms of each feature

Refer to the `data-info.md` file for a detailed report of the analysis findings.


## Further Analysis

The EDA provides a foundation for further analysis, including:

* Feature engineering: Creating new features based on existing ones.
* Model selection: Choosing appropriate machine learning models for prediction or classification tasks.
* Model training and evaluation: Building and assessing the performance of predictive models.
